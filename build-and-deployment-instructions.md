#Instructions

##Create an account with Redhat - OpenShift Online (Next Gen)

See for documentation: https://docs.openshift.com/online/welcome/index.html

##OpenShift Online

Open the OpenShift Console by following this link after having signed in with your OpenShift Online (Next Gen) User Account.

https://console.preview.openshift.com/console/

The first time you will see a 'Welcome to OpenShift.' message and a button to create a New Project.

###New Project

Click the 'New Project' button on the console (as mentioned above) to create a new project.

When asked, answer the following questions:

***Name***: Give a unique name for the project, e.g. totaljs-001

***Display Name***: Give the name as it will be displayed, e.g. TotalJS - 001

***Description***: Give a description of the project, e.g. A TotalJS Project (001)

Follow by clicking the 'Create' button

Next, on the 'Browse Catalog' tab, choose from a web framework. Here fill in 'node' in the filter text input field.

You will be given (at least) two options:

- Node.js  <-- Choose this one
- Node.js + MongoDB (Persistent)

Choose Node.js ( Builds source code. Build and run Node.js 4 applications on RHEL 7. For more information about using this builder image, including OpenShift considerations, https://github.com/sclorg/s2i-nodejs-container/blob/master/4/README.md ) 

Choose the latest version (i.e. 4 -- latest at the time of this writing).

Confirm by clicking the 'Select' button.

You will be shown the following:

Node.js

Build and run Node.js 4 applications on RHEL 7. For more information about using this builder image, including OpenShift considerations, see https://github.com/sclorg/s2i-nodejs-container/blob/master/4/README.md.

Version: 4

***Name***: Give a name, e.g. totaljs-001-nodejs-4

***Git Repository URL***: Give the repository for the nodejs application, here https://github.com/willem-vanheemstrasystems/openshift-totaljs.git

Show advanced routing, build, deployment and source options by clicking the link with the same name.

It will show the following:

***Git Reference***: master
Optional branch, tag, or commit.

***Context Dir***: /
Optional subdirectory for the application source code, used as the context directory for the build.

***Source Secret***: Secret name ( we will leave this blank for the moment )
Secret with credentials for pulling your source code. 

The option to 'Create new secret'. We will not do so now.

##Routing

Routing is a way to make your application publicly visible. Otherwise you may only be able to access your application by its IP address, if allowed by the system administrator.

Create a route to the application

***Hostname***: www.example.com ( We will leave this blank for now )
Public hostname for the route. If not specified, a hostname is generated. The hostname can't be changed after the route is created.

***Path***: /
Path that the router watches to route traffic to the service.

***Target Port***: 8080/TCP
Target port for traffic

[Optional] Secure route (leave unchecked for now)
routes can be secured using several TLS termination types for serving certificates.

##Build configuration

A build configuration describes how to build your deployable image. This includes your source, the base builder image, and when to launch new builds.

[Checked] Configure a webhook build trigger
[Checked] Automatically build a new image when the builder image changes
[Checked] Launch the first build when the build configuration is created

Environment Variables (Build and Runtime)

Environment variables are used to configure and pass information to running containers. These environment variables will be available during your build and at runtime.

[Optional] ***name***  ***value*** (leave blank for now)
___

##Deployment Configuration

Deployment configurations describe how your application is configured by the cluster and under what conditions it should be recreated (e.g. when the image changes).

Autodeply when
[Checked] New image is available
[Checked] Deployment configuration changes

Environment Variables (Runtime only)

Environment variables are used to configure and pass information to running containers. These environment variables will only be available at runtime.

These variables exist on the image and will be available at runtime. You may override them below.

***PATH***: /opt/app-root/src/node_modules/.bin/:/opt/app-root/src/.npm-global/bin/:/opt/app-root/src/bin:/opt/app-root/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin

***container***: docker

***STI_SCRIPTS_URL***: image:///usr/libexec/s2i

***STI_SCRIPTS_PATH***: /usr/libexec/s2i

***HOME***: /opt/app-root/src

***BASH_ENV***: /opt/app-root/etc/scl_enable

***ENV***: /opt/app-root/etc/scl_enable

***PROMPT_COMMAND***: . /opt/app-root/etc/scl_enable

***NODEJS_VERSION***: 4

***NPM_RUN***: start

***NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX***: /opt/app-root/src/.npm-global

[Optional] ***name***  ***value*** (leave blank for now)
___

##Scaling

Scaling defines the number of running instances of your built image.

***Strategy***: Manual

Scale replicas manually or automatically based on CPU usage.

***Replicas***: 1

The number of instances of your image.
___

##Resource Limits

Resource limits controle compute resource usage by a container on a node.

***Memory***: 512 MiB (215 MiB min to 1 GiB max)
The amount of Memory the container is limited to use.
___

##Labels

Labels are used to organize, group, or select objects and resources, such as pods.

The following labels are being added automatically. If you want to override them, you can do so below.

***app***: totaljs-001-nodejs-4

Each label is applied to each created resource.

[Optional] ***name***  ***value*** (leave blank for now)

Manage your app

The web console is convenient, but if you need deeper control you may want to try our command line tools.

Command line tools

[Download and install](https://console.preview.openshift.com/console/command-line) the oc command line tool. After that, you can start by logging in, switching to this particular project, and displaying an overview of it, by doing:

```javascript
oc login https://api.preview.openshift.com
oc project totaljs-001
oc status
```

For more information about the command line tools, check the [CLI Reference](https://docs.openshift.com/online/cli_reference/index.html) and [Basic CLI Operations](https://docs.openshift.com/online/cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.html).

Making code changes

A GitHub [webhook trigger](https://docs.openshift.com/online/dev_guide/builds.html#webhook-triggers) has been created for the totaljs-001-nodejs-4 build config.

You can now set up the webhook in the GitHub repository settings if you own it, in https://github.com/willem-vanheemstrasystems/openshift-totaljs/settings/hooks, using the following payload URL:

```javascript
https://api.preview.openshift.com/oapi/v1/namespaces/totaljs-001/buildconfigs/totaljs-001-nodejs-4/webhooks/1900155032f5e94c/github
```

Webhooks allow external services to be notified when certain events happen within your repository. When the specified events happen, weâ€™ll send a POST request to each of the URLs you provide. Learn more in our Webhooks Guide.

***NOTE***: Set the content type of the webhook at Github to 'application/json' (returns 200 - success) instead of 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' (returns 400 - failed).

Click on 'Go to overview.'

#Overview

https://console.preview.openshift.com/console/project/totaljs-001/overview

***NOTE***: When you see a notification like this, choose to add a health check:

totaljs-001-nodejs-4 has containers without health checks, which ensure your application is running correctly. Add health checks.

##Health Checks: totaljs-001-nodejs-4

Container health is periodically checked using readiness and liveness probes.

###Readiness Probe

A readiness probe checks if the container is ready to handle requests. A failed readiness probe means that a container should not receive any traffic from a proxy, even if it's running.

Add a Readiness Probe:

***Type***: HTTP

***Path***: /

***Port***: 8080

***Initial Delay***: 60 seconds
How long to wait after the container starts before checking its health.

***Timeout***: 60 seconds
How long to wait for the probe to finish. If the time is exceeded, the probe is considered failed.

###Liveness Probe

A liveness probe checks if the container is still running. If the liveness probe fails, the container is killed.

Add a Liveness Probe

***Type***: HTTP

***Path***: /

***Port***: 8080

***Initial Delay***: 60 seconds
How long to wait after the container starts before checking its health.

***Timeout***: 60 seconds
How long to wait for the probe to finish. If the time is exceeded, the probe is considered failed.
